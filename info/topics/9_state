Why do we need state?

Rendering flow of components

useState hook:
    UserForm.js
        - register some state
        - each component has own state
        - each component has own instance
        - each component is a pure function
        - life cycle on state change
        - react schedules state updates
        - multiple state
    UserForm.useStateAsObject.js
        - multiple state as object
        - update state that depends on the previous state
    UserForm.sharedHandler.js
        - shared handler ()
    UsersPage.js
        - computed state
