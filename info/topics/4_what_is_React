React is:
    - JavaScript library for building user interfaces (https://reactjs.org/)
    - Client-side Javascript library
    - All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web
    - Make complex user interfaces easier
    - About splitting application into small building blocks, small components where every component have clear task.
    - Component-focused approach
    - Lean and focused component-based UI library.

Reactive way:
    Things happen instantly, not need to wait for new pages to load
Traditional way:
    Request to a server after click a link or a button and new html page send back

We can use JavaScript to change DOM of the loaded page and React give us one of the easiest way to do this.

React allows us to build SPA (Single-Page-Applications).
