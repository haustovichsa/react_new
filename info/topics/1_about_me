I've been working with Coherent Solutions for 10 years.

I used to be .NET developer for 4 or 5 years.

I've been working for 6-7 years on the Wildflower project as full stack developer
(Javascript, NodeJS, React, Redux, TypeScript, Mongo, Postgres, Docker, Jenkins, ...).

Currently I'm in Poland.

I like playing squash, table tennis, basketball, chess
